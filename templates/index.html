                <h2>Kristian Smith</h2>
                <p>My name is Kristian Smith. My passion for street food and rich cultures culminated in my first cookbook, "Roots:
                Jamaican Food and Cuisine." Whether you’re reading it in Swedish, German, or soon in English, I invite you to savour the
                authentic Jamaican flavours that resonate deeply with my heritage.</p>
                <p>From the rhythmic beats of reggae to the aromatic jerk spices wafting through the air, my cookbook promises to transport
                you to the sun-kissed shores of Jamaica. This isn't just about recipes; it's an homage to a culture, a people, and the
                flavours that have shaped my culinary journey.</p>
                <p>While you're here, don't miss out on my blog. It’s where I delve deeper into global cuisines, share the stories behind my dishes, and offer a taste of what's next in my gastronomic explorations.
                <br>Dive in, savour, and let the flavours of Jamaica dance on your palate.</p>
                <p>Enjoy!

                    <h2>About this book</h2>
                    <p>20 years ago, I was a freshman in a restaurant kitchen, a guy who had just finished cooking school in London. That was when my Jamaican dad brought the whole family to the island for the first time. Once there, we didn't end up among the tourists' luxurious hotel complexes - dad showed us the real Jamaica.<br></p>
                    <p>Living and eating with the locals made me discover my Jamaican roots. The smokey aroma of burning pimento in grills packed with jerk chicken, the spicy fish dishes down by the beach, the pride and joy of cooking - all of which I convey in this book Jamaican food culture is a result of the island's exciting history, and I have made it my mission to spread all the knowledge I have managed to gather.</p>
                    <br>In Roots, you learn the secrets behind authentic Jamaican cooking.</p>
