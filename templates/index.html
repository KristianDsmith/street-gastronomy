                <h2>Kristian Smith</h2>
                <p>I started my career at Anthony Worrall Thompson Delugo's in Soho, London as a young chef, straight after my restaurant training, to gain early experience in my profession. In recent years, I have been based in Stockholm where I was responsible for the culinary creativity at the world-famous restaurant Flippin' Burgers and its sister restaurants LÃ¥dan and Dogfood.
                I have always had a passion for street food, an interest and fascination that has developed stronger over the years. 
                I am also debuting my first cookbook which will be an in-depth look at Jamaican roots, food and culture. The book will be released in Sweden under the publisher Natur & Kultur in spring 2020.

                    <h3>About this book</h3>
                    <p>20 years ago, I was a freshman in a restaurant kitchen, a guy who had just finished cooking school in London. That was when my Jamaican dad brought the whole family to the island for the first time. Once there, we didn't end up among the tourists' luxurious hotel complexes - dad showed us the real Jamaica. Living and eating with the locals made me discover my Jamaican roots. The smokey aroma of burning pimento in grills packed with jerk chicken, the spicy fish dishes down by the beach, the pride and joy of cooking - all of which I convey in this book Jamaican food culture is a result of the island's exciting history, and I have made it my mission to spread all the knowledge I have managed to gather.
                    <br>In Roots, you learn the secrets behind authentic Jamaican cooking.</p>
